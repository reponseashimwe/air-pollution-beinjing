# Air Quality Forecasting Project Roadmap

## Project Overview

**Objective**: Predict PM2.5 concentrations in Beijing using RNN/LSTM models
**Target**: RMSE < 4000 on Kaggle leaderboard
**Dataset**: Historical air quality and weather data from Beijing

## Current State Analysis

From the existing notebook, I can see:

-   Basic LSTM model with 32 units, single layer
-   Simple preprocessing (fillna with mean, basic normalization)
-   Limited data exploration
-   Only 10 epochs training
-   Current approach treats each sample independently (no proper time series sequences)

## Key Issues to Address

1. **Time Series Structure**: Current model doesn't properly utilize temporal sequences
2. **Limited Feature Engineering**: No lag features, rolling averages, or temporal patterns
3. **Shallow Architecture**: Single LSTM layer may be insufficient
4. **Minimal Hyperparameter Tuning**: Only basic parameters tested
5. **Insufficient Data Exploration**: Missing critical visualizations and analysis
